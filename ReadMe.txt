NSLookup Utility in C++
This project is a simple command-line utility written in C++ that mimics the behavior of the nslookup command. 
It resolves domain names into IP addresses and retrieves information about DNS records, similar to the native nslookup command.

Step 1:
            ./build.sh 

Step 2: 
            ./my_nslookup google.com

Output:
	    Name      : google.com
            IP Address: 142.250.182.238
	    IP Address: 2404:6800:4009:81f::200e
